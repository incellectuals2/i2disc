## Development

Something like

```bash
apt install pip
pip install flit
flit install -s
```

## Use

- Get a folder full of your favorite incellectuals2 content.
- Set your Discord token in the environment as `INCEL2_DISCORD_TOKEN`.
- Set a `|`-separated list of file extensions to pull from the archive, e.g.
  `jpg|mp4`, as `INCEL2_DISCORD_EXTS`.
- Set the archive directory as `INCEL2_DISCORD_IMGROOT`.
- (Currently unused) set the regex for captions as `INCEL2_DISCORD_CAPTIONS`.

Then run with:

```bash
i2disc
```

This will probably fail since you were never meant to use this. It's okay.
